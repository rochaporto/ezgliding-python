These are the release notes for the ezgliding.com software. You can find

WHAT IS EZGLIDING.COM?

  ezgliding.com is a website offering a set of web applications to help
  with analysing, visualising and planning glider flights.

  Initial features include aggregation of glider flights and simple
  visualization, more coming later.

  It is distributed under the GNU General Public License - see the
  accompanying COPYING file for more details.

REQUIREMENTS:

  All you need to use the ezgliding.com web applications is a modern
  web browser. 
  
  In the future it is possible that additional requirements are
  introduced, for example to access attached physical resources.

DOCUMENTATION:

  All applications should be fairly self explanatory, if not they're
  accompanied by the appropriate online help.

DEVELOPING:

  ezgliding.com relies mostly on appengine for its backend.

  1) If not available, download the appengine sdk
     http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html

  2) Launch the appengine dev server
  # <appengine sdk>/dev_appserver.py python

  3) Check for a working admin console at:
